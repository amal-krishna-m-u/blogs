We first define a traditional function summonDragon and an arrow function summonPhoenix to demonstrate the syntax difference.
Next, we show how arrow functions are useful in callback functions. We define a traditional function performJutsu that takes a callback function and invoke it. Then, we define an arrow function performTechnique that does the same.
We call performJutsu and performTechnique, passing in an anonymous function as the callback, which logs "Jutsu completed!" and "Technique completed!" respectively.
This example illustrates how arrow functions provide a more concise syntax compared to traditional functions, making code easier to read and write. Just as mastering new techniques enhances a ninja's skills, using arrow functions enhances JavaScript code efficiency.
