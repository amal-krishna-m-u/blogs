In this example, we'll explore array destructuring using an anime reference from "Naruto":
The unleashNinjaDetails function takes an array containing ninja details as its parameter.
We use array destructuring to extract the elements of the array directly into variables ninjaName, village, and bounty.
These variables then hold the values of the respective elements of the ninjaDetails array.
Finally, we log the ninja's name, village, and bounty to the console.
This example illustrates how array destructuring simplifies the extraction of values from arrays, making code more concise and readable. Just as a ninja swiftly evades attacks in battle, JavaScript can quickly access data with destructuring.
