In this example, we'll explore how destructuring works using an anime reference from "Bleach" and the concept of Zanpakuto:

The unleashZanpakuto function takes an object containing Zanpakuto information as its parameter.
We log details such as the Zanpakuto's name, release command, and abilities.
Then, we create a new object representing a Zanpakuto's abilities with keys shikai, bankai, and ability.
We use object destructuring to extract these values directly from the zanpakuto object and log them.
This example demonstrates how destructuring simplifies the extraction of values from objects, making code cleaner and more readable. Just as a Soul Reaper unleashes the power of their Zanpakuto with a release command, JavaScript can quickly access data with destructuring.
