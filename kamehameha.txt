In the coding world, where techniques are as diverse as Goku's moves, we'll explore the "Kamehameha" of JavaScript - the spread operator! Just like Goku charges up his ki to unleash this move, coders use the spread operator to duplicate arrays.

Our journey begins with Goku coding away, and he decides to unleash a Kamehameha on an array of ingredients. With a shout, he applies the spread operator, scattering the elements into a new array, just like the energy waves of his Kamehameha.

Seeing the result, Goku finds his coding ingredients perfectly duplicated, ready for action. But he notices something interesting - the original array remains untouched! It's like making a clone of himself for battle, leaving the original Goku untouched.

Thus, Goku's coding adventure teaches him the power of the spread operator - it clones arrays like a Kamehameha, leaving the original intact for more coding battles!
